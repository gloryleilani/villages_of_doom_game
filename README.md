## Project Intro
Villages of Doom was a project I built during Hackbright's Python 101 course during summer 2020. I was inspired to create this project to bring joy to players, young and old. In addition, building the game allowed me to practice creating functions and using Python data structures such as dictionaries. 

I wrote this program using Python and it's currently implemented using the command line interface.

## About the Developer
Lani graduated from Stanford University with a B.S. in Industrial Engineering and a M.A. in Sociology with a focus on "Organizations, Business and the Economy." She worked in real estate private equity investing in New York for several years and grew determined to help modernize the industry. She joined a startup in San Francisco building an online investment marketplace and became a product manager. She later joined a B2B SaaS company selling a CRM, an end-user portal, and investment management products. In her Product Management roles, Lani enjoyed deciding which products to build and why, but she grew increasingly interested in how to build the products, which led her to software engineering.

#### Introduction to the game
Upon initiating the game, the user sees this message, "You accidentally stepped through a portal while playing with rocks in your backyard--you've found yourself in a forested area containing villages. You are searching for the portal to get home. You have 25 units of life and you are in village 6. Your goal is to find the portal before your life ends."

The user can make choices and move around the map by typing into the command line in response to the game's prompts. 

#### Navigating the map
The game has a map containing 16 adjacent villages, laid out in a grid. Each village contains items that the user can interact with. The user needs to figure out which items will help him/her escape the villages and return home. Once the user collects all of the "right" items in his/her bag, the game is won.


## <a name="future"></a>The Future of Villages of Doom
Possible future features:
* A browser-based user interface with graphics
* A larger map containing more items than the current map

The goal would be to make this a more fully-featured game.
